Clojure library to access Denizbank ALGOLAB infrastructure.

## Usage

You will have to initialize three environment variables for ALGOLAB:
- ALGOLAB_APIKEY: apiKey given by ALGOLAB for access
- ALGOLAB_USERNAME: TCKN of ALGOLAB account
- ALGOLAB_PASSWORD: password of ALGOLAB account

In order to access the API, you'll need to call the login function and then the login-sms-code function with the received code.
The hash received from this flow is required to generate the checker, which is used to validate all API requests.

Invoke a library API function from the command-line:

    $ clojure -X btezergil.algolab-lib/foo :a 1 :b '"two"'
    {:a 1, :b "two"} "Hello, World!"

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build a JAR (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the JAR in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

Install it locally (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment
variables (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build deploy

Your library will be deployed to net.clojars.btezergil/algolab-lib on clojars.org by default.
